# 3 Missing values exercise

1. Find all the observations where the carbohydrates are missing.

```{r}
beer[is.na(beer$carbohydrates),]
```


2. Find all the observations where the brand is missing.

```{r}
beer[is.na(beer$brand),]
```


3. What is different about the observations missing carbohydrates and the observations missing brand? To clean the data should be drop the rows missing brand or the rows missing carbohydrates?

There is essentially fully incomplete rows where there are missing brands. 
dropping the the rows with missing brand would be a better idea.
